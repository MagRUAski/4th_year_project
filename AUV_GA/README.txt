This is a Genetic Algorithm using Nearest Neighbor for solving AUV
Path Planning problem in UASNs with Data Harvesting.
It can simulate the path planning process using GA and show evolution
of fitness.

To simulate:

1. Run 'RP_coordinate.m' to generate nodes randomly. Coordinates and
   Adjacency Matrix will be saved in 'coor.mat'.

2. Run 'main.m', set population size and iteration threshold.

3. To compare performance differences between GA,NN, and Dynamic Programming,
   Run 'NN.m' and 'DynamicProgram.m'.
